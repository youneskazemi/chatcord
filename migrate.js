BISCORD MIGRATION GUIDE
==========================================================

The Biscord codebase has been restructured for better maintainability.
Here's how to migrate from the old structure to the new one:

1. The new structure is already set up in the 'src/' directory
2. The database connection is now in 'src/config/database.js'
3. Database schema and initialization is in 'src/models/schema.js'
4. Database models are split into:
   - src/models/users.js
   - src/models/messages.js
   - src/models/channels.js
   - src/models/directMessages.js
5. Socket event handlers are in 'src/socket/handlers.js'
6. Socket initialization is in 'src/socket/index.js'
7. API routes are in 'src/routes/api.js'
8. The main server file is now 'src/index.js'

To start using the new structure:

1. Make sure all your changes in the old server.js are reflected in the new structure
2. Update package.json to use the new entry point (already done)
3. Run the server with 'npm start' or 'npm run dev'

If you need to add new features:
- Add new models in the src/models/ directory
- Add new routes in the src/routes/ directory
- Add new socket handlers in the src/socket/handlers.js file
- Add new middleware in the src/middleware/ directory
- Add new utilities in the src/utils/ directory
